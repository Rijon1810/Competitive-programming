/*
* A simple program to find the prime and also the phi of n numbers.
* This program is helpful, in case we need the phi of a lot of numbers.
* Phi is the representation of Euler's Totient function.
* For a number n, The number of all the numbers from 0 to n that are co-primes of n (greater than 1) is phi.
* i.e Phi(12)=4, the numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12, the co-primes of 12 (greater than 1) are 2,3,5, and 7. So the value of phi is 4
